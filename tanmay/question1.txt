Q.1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.

Ans:
Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. With the "cherry-pick" command, Git allows you to integrate selected, individual commits from any branch into your current HEAD Brranch. 
The Following steps are :-
1. The current branch and HEAD pointer stay at the last commit successfully made.

2. The CHERRY_PICK_HEAD ref is set to point at the commit that introduced the change that is difficult to apply.

3. Paths in which the change applied cleanly are updated both in the index file and in your working tree.

4. For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions, as described in the "TRUE MERGE" section of git-merge[1]. The working tree files will include a description of the conflict bracketed by the usual conflict markers <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>.
