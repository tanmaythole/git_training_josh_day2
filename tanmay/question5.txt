Q.5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

Ans:
force overwrites a remote branch with your local branch. --force-with-lease is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits were added to the remote branch (by another team-member or coworker or what have you). It ensures you do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.

When to Use Force with Lease :-
Assuming a regular push does not work, one does not need to use force if they are doing decent day-to-day work. Every day-to-day need is satisfied with force-with-lease. These include any sort of a rebase, particularly:
Rebase a branch onto another branch,
Rewording a commit in the past,
Squashing a few commits together,
Reordering the commits, or
Changing the author of a previous commit.

When to Use Force:-
When doing something nasty. This includes:
Removing a commit together with its contributions from history,
Removing a large file that was accidentally committed from history,
Removing a folder from the repo together with all its history.
