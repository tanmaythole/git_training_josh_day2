Q.3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit. 

Ans:
In Git you can merge several commits into one with the powerful interactive rebase. It's a handy tool I use quite often; I usually tidy up my working space by grouping together several small intermediate commits into a single lump to push upstream.

To combine 2 commits i.e. C2 and C3 we uses git rebase --interactive HEAD~[N] where N is the number of commits we want to combine. So in our case N = 2 and HEAD must be on C2 for combining 2 commits.
